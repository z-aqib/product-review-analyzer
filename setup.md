ADD THESE 3 LINES IN APP.PY
>import boto3

>s3 = boto3.client('s3')
>s3.download_file('your-bucket-name', 'model.pkl', 'model.pkl'))
Run your modelâ€™s FastAPI/Flask/Streamlit serve

if mlops-key.pem gets a warning for unsafe, run this with correct path, in powershell as administrator
icacls "D:\sem7\mlops\project\product-review-analyzer\mlops-key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "D:\sem7\mlops\project\product-review-analyzer\mlops-key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"

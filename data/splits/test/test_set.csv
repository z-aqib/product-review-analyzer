I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps

B08B42LWKN,AGCRCU432TIF4J2EL7GBEWOIULGQ,R2LK4WPIHJ7WDA,Better product in this budget,Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies
B08B42LWKN,AERQBL3BISJQVHO3RLOOA4HKZX5A,R6IPR9FHZ5BOT,Product review,and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality.

But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning

I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home
B08B42LWKN,AHIH3QL5XONYJWEXF7VKLFHZBDJA,R1QA870NJWIODF,Budget friendly TV,I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.

B09CMM3VGK,AH4QNGP7K2SO6FBWTS4Y274VHV6A,RKKX7CGMNCZLA,Wait  to get mexmum discount.,The cable is awesome and no charging issue till now.... Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product ü§ûüèª

B09CMM3VGK,AF4GBAADHEMI3ZLPBAIZWYWN7GJA,R2RS0DMJ29X2W6,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn't insert it into my phone's charging port without removing the case!
B09CMM3VGK,AGOMXFNBIQBEWLN4JDC65FDPTBDQ,RLLQ8T7VXWR65,Good but issues with design,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ‚Çπ99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ‚Çπ150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai.

I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car
B07232M876,AFW6NV5N3FUXV3CNUACPSYC5AB3Q,R2YU5RDRT44DE6,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob
B07232M876,AEW6KBDGJEWIOQKAW3FP74GMV6TA,R1K5FLRLAUZLKF,Super,I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility
B07232M876,AEGT7WPGXXMSH5J3LZLL6CPJ7QMQ,R1HAZS2PLM3RRQ,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance
B07232M876,AEKCUG7WMX6KMP6VFBWI3ICW5CBQ,R3EX1BCG3VPANF,Good,I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable
B07232M876,AF2544C4RGIBQX7Y4JMKMSMXMRRQ,R1C72DNWTJGUI2,Excellent quality cable,there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps.

B07MKFNHKG,AFIU4APGHOFMXEOVMSQMYKMZ46QQ,RFZ1X95QMXWFZ,Firestick plugging in issue,I got this for 6k. At this price point
B07MKFNHKG,AEOFYPCJJQYCKISUR6EC66IZH23Q,R1P8SL54VCWSMQ,otherwise a good deal,I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall
B07MKFNHKG,AFZSMXS2MILXOSTT2ZEJDE3W7TLQ,RSWY4LT0L7TCL,Cheap & Best Product,I'd say

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4.

B09Q5SWVBJ,AGCRCU432TIF4J2EL7GBEWOIULGQ,R2LK4WPIHJ7WDA,Better product in this budget,Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies
B09Q5SWVBJ,AERQBL3BISJQVHO3RLOOA4HKZX5A,R6IPR9FHZ5BOT,Product review,and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning
B09Q5SWVBJ,AHIWNZ2HBQAHVE4OWODM6WH4PMOQ,R3DU4LFGTAIEMN,nice tv,and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still
B09Q5SWVBJ,AH2347WTE3DZ3TIZUB5LCLZPAYEQ,RVHHM5FW31JN1,Best product,nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home
B09Q5SWVBJ,AHIH3QL5XONYJWEXF7VKLFHZBDJA,R1QA870NJWIODF,Budget friendly TV,I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models

B08R69VDHT,AEDLLY6JXNCVYIW227SBCPVYHNUA,R9ISXRV6DA0OY,Nice quality‚Ä¶ trustable‚Ä¶,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price
B08R69VDHT,AGTJ44UNO6K5X567YLQPYGN3TV4Q,RZFW11UFTCBVH,Just well in this price.,na
B08R69VDHT,AFYCBABBI2GCQRSCKIRHPLQNO72A,R1WGHB13Q2OLYA,supports 2.4 amps fast charging,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that
B08R69VDHT,AG55XGEMTFKS7BXQTNFKHFTMMW5A,R11ETJ640KDIRW,Nice,i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging

B09RWZRCP1,AFJVYK4FXVGRSTSLGVUE5JGB2NVA,RMEKYV7XWTWKV,Better..!!,Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...
B09RWZRCP1,AEVJIJSEUXPBRKOQ2PB4JNBUTFRA,R1PYVXH6MGUQLU,Charging speed is not guaranteed!,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables
B09RWZRCP1,AGRLDCPA7VJZZTV4GUIODVQ3DTHA,R3FUT08S34HBHW,Exactly as advertised,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable
B09RWZRCP1,AEUDATTJUCKFQ5ETVLUU57ZZ3XXQ,R2X57Q7030Q9DG,Excellent warp charge cable,that would make it more durable. In my experience
B09RWZRCP1,AEGR6ZYWXPEZWM7JUEBWQHAOPS2A,REPXGC5R2LG85,Nice,braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent
B09RWZRCP1,AEETOHX32FYDRI6SIAW7L76Q2NHQ,R399JBQZ8JKDKC,Amazing cable,I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps

B09Q5P2MT3,AE7OMK3IQJR2U2JZE2HQ4BKSPA6A,RUFFV2QR43OCM,It's really worth the money but,WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix
B09Q5P2MT3,AGCRCU432TIF4J2EL7GBEWOIULGQ,R2LK4WPIHJ7WDA,Better product in this budget,Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies
B09Q5P2MT3,AERQBL3BISJQVHO3RLOOA4HKZX5A,R6IPR9FHZ5BOT,Product review,and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality.

But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning
B09Q5P2MT3,AHIWNZ2HBQAHVE4OWODM6WH4PMOQ,R3DU4LFGTAIEMN,nice tv,and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still
B09Q5P2MT3,AH2347WTE3DZ3TIZUB5LCLZPAYEQ,RVHHM5FW31JN1,Best product,nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home
B09Q5P2MT3,AHIH3QL5XONYJWEXF7VKLFHZBDJA,R1QA870NJWIODF,Budget friendly TV,I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.

B0B9XLX8VR,AHY6AK5LXBTGXDDXSU57ISMDW55Q,R2G4T57OLXDVPL,Good TV for the price. (But my experience was not perfect),Screen quality is good.It's been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1‚Ä¢ It doesn't have default option to directly start on tata sky tv
B0B9XLX8VR,AGULFHMPCHCL32WCIP4GEGWFVZEQ,R3IQ8PWVTWENBY,Good but not best  @!@,we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2‚Ä¢ dosent allow us to command/choose volume up or down from set-top box remote (mine tata sky)We have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv
B0B9XLX8VR,AFVZXMXYRXVM3VBDLGX45W34GQ4Q,RH6UHEBP622FT,Decent tv for the price but misses on basic smart features,mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion: If someone ask's me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability( just like me ) then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony ??? Definitely no!!.

B09RX1FK54,AFJVYK4FXVGRSTSLGVUE5JGB2NVA,RMEKYV7XWTWKV,Better..!!,Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...
B09RX1FK54,AEVJIJSEUXPBRKOQ2PB4JNBUTFRA,R1PYVXH6MGUQLU,Charging speed is not guaranteed!,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables
B09RX1FK54,AGRLDCPA7VJZZTV4GUIODVQ3DTHA,R3FUT08S34HBHW,Exactly as advertised,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable
B09RX1FK54,AEUDATTJUCKFQ5ETVLUU57ZZ3XXQ,R2X57Q7030Q9DG,Excellent warp charge cable,that would make it more durable. In my experience
B09RX1FK54,AEGR6ZYWXPEZWM7JUEBWQHAOPS2A,REPXGC5R2LG85,Nice,braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent
B09RX1FK54,AEETOHX32FYDRI6SIAW7L76Q2NHQ,R399JBQZ8JKDKC,Amazing cable,I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.

B08Y55LPBF,AHGJ2DNFP3OJWO73XW2R7TDXI7WA,R2S5VBYYN51ELA,"Mi Smart Tv 32"" :- 7/10 average.",I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN

B0B3XY5YT4,AFCWL3MX7BP2ZUDD37MEAENZDQ2A,RC3ZLDRM8GA9T,Love Amazon but lg is misleading,There's no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier. The magic remote costs around 3k approximately.Display: when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots.Immediately called up Amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visit.The tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what's the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it.So i waited for 2 days again and nothing was showing up on Amazon app about replacement so doubting it I called up Amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within 4 days.This time the replacement came and was good.

B0859M539M,AHYUZ2BLKNN6UJLFYWCXCEFZTOVQ,R3NZCVYJBN0CPD,Best for kali. Do not read another review.,since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds
B0859M539M,AHBST4ZJ5665DV2TCR4W4J2OI3DA,RHUJOS46Q51UG,Nice product,"at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon"
B0859M539M,AGHPOFCHZ73Q2Q2IFTCJLUSEL2NQ,R1ZW4PQHUECROJ,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit

B0859M539M,AF23GXF525XSMXPJBEHP4SPKOZNQ,R2WZHK2E301YV,Awesome and easy to use,the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS
B0859M539M,AFX5NHAAOUKKENAT6GWNKY3X5YTQ,R10J01VHCKFB42,Good product,which also worked.Ultimately

Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.
B081FG1QYX,AFID7FPYXSKYIQ4TXVZRJLDCTNWQ,R1H9W7ECR79TX2,Good charging capacity and data transfers,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars
B081FG1QYX,AEH3VHBR2ECN647RYG3VNMASKBWA,RIAQUZT21P6N1,I bought it for my bike,I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use
B081FG1QYX,AEZCPNPTW4BIFN7P2QFA3ML4ZKUQ,RFIJDX0AGS6ZR,Excellent,the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality
B081FG1QYX,AHJHV3JIPUMAT274GIFQKJPKXNMA,R2Q20EL3OJ81U2,üëç,the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle

B08CTNJ985,AHJB3PWCLPLMFBNCOPP5AM3TSXOQ,R2WOUJZTB4QW94,Not the correct charger for Samsung S9,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.

B07MDRGHWQ,AFIU4APGHOFMXEOVMSQMYKMZ46QQ,RFZ1X95QMXWFZ,Firestick plugging in issue,I got this for 6k. At this price point
B07MDRGHWQ,AEOFYPCJJQYCKISUR6EC66IZH23Q,R1P8SL54VCWSMQ,otherwise a good deal,I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall

B095JQVC7N,AG3QTVXT2ODRVKOQJJRDV5KA2F2A,R2PF9QV9JEQO9K,Almost Perfect!,Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates
B095JQVC7N,AGEYM57JOHPNX77ZYVSXPTX4FVNA,R2NEN86P63G4ES,Review After using 1month,the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube
B095JQVC7N,AHH557DUFIPFPRKDZ3K76U2DJ35Q,R302B7X6H0GIC0,Nice tv,Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However
B095JQVC7N,AE5WEK33Q53BHDQAPWRPVEN5OPZA,R3H9O8F9LUY5N9,Panel and video quality,after using it for 2 months
B095JQVC7N,AGFDV2VE2PFK2W7FQZXLEPHK2BAA,R1RGSA8QU78640,Good Product,the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now
B095JQVC7N,AFOOUANHTKWSTZRG3HSE3TR7L5CQ,R2B3DRF8V2A9QI,Worth for money,up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes
B095JQVC7N,AEV7X32J6CUVHXXRZJ7EI7XSXYVA,R1KF9HPUVJTM0I,Nice,I set brightness to 0
B095JQVC7N,AG7MREPON3XAAGY4WT4YGA7DZWCA,R3OCQ19TZWHSN5,Good,and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes

B081FJWN52,AH3ZH5IE4MTFB3T33O3QSGLU4BBA,R3CGMQSB9H564N,Good pick for Galaxy Note 9,I purchased the cable for my Galaxy Note 9 in July 2022. Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.
B081FJWN52,AEQHHPCXUH4O5BS4VOQNDBTAAORQ,RG5V69YDA5TLP,Durable and quality product,Overall good for usage
B081FJWN52,AFMIGQ3PROFIPTSPVGLBI5XEXCDA,R18ESJU4TI0EGY,Best Cable for Android Auto,not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.
B081FJWN52,AE2YKXGI2XFOVDHNL6FF2RQAZ55A,R140SU5IGEW7FF,The cable I will always carry when I pack my stuff for a ride.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.
B081FJWN52,AFID7FPYXSKYIQ4TXVZRJLDCTNWQ,R1H9W7ECR79TX2,Good charging capacity and data transfers,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars
B081FJWN52,AEH3VHBR2ECN647RYG3VNMASKBWA,RIAQUZT21P6N1,I bought it for my bike,I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use
B081FJWN52,AEZCPNPTW4BIFN7P2QFA3ML4ZKUQ,RFIJDX0AGS6ZR,Excellent,the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality
B081FJWN52,AHJHV3JIPUMAT274GIFQKJPKXNMA,R2Q20EL3OJ81U2,üëç,the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle

B08CT62BM1,AFVNMGQ2XHQL55BFESLIHGPCW6LA,R1LNA5SHXIW7IM,Worth the money spent,Cable is long and durable. Its worth the purchase.
B08CT62BM1,AFRUZM3EU3T6M7HFW6MUXQKJBZCQ,RGCS38FNYUI9H,Nice product also the sterdiness good as expected.,I recommend this product whoever needs a sturdy and fast charging also keep in mind your charger needs to support while using this cable
B08CT62BM1,AHJB3PWCLPLMFBNCOPP5AM3TSXOQ,R2WOUJZTB4QW94,Not the correct charger for Samsung S9,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.

B08CT62BM1,AHKEHV7YSGK2ZCMEUQYS6LJNURKA,RST6G0XZXY8O3,Doubts on fast charging,I have oneplus 6 mobile phone and have dash charger and oneplus cable which becomes a fast charging combo.However when i plugged in this cable with dash charger. It was not rapidly charging my phone. So I can't say if this is fast charging cable ot not.But as a common charging cable this is working perfectly fine
B08CT62BM1,AGLZGGJLEO2WGEMX4KZCFNEJX64A,R24V8P9TKOO83N,One time purchase,This is one of the best cable for fast charging. I have 3 units of 2 meter c type cable. I don't think it will get damage soon. The quality is very good and charging S22 ultra

B07F1P8KNV,AFZ7US7H622UBLYL4ZX2XEHT7FHQ,R2K7MABWMAQE26,Good product. Little bit fast charger for phones like redmi.,unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced OEM cables from Apple and Samsung. I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance
B07F1P8KNV,AFDDH5QGUJ2NHJZBIAPEQVUIQCKA,R33YS4PO3JWU23,Fast charging is working properly,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.

B0B997FBZT,AHH2JUMVFGEUJXW5SFUOAIRZBVJQ,R10S2P5H6YODNY,Acer 32  Sound bar tv review,if we want to see good picture we need to maintain minimum distance to tv because this tv pixels are so big. But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.
B0B997FBZT,AEB5LUPJLVMRBV2DQYWOLGIC2OXQ,R2ILGDHXO6XX4K,product is good but one lie by the seller (i.e. 16GB space),Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine.

B0B3XXSB1K,AFCWL3MX7BP2ZUDD37MEAENZDQ2A,RC3ZLDRM8GA9T,Love Amazon but lg is misleading,There's no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier. The magic remote costs around 3k approximately.Display: when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots.Immediately called up Amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visit.The tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what's the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it.So i waited for 2 days again and nothing was showing up on Amazon app about replacement so doubting it I called up Amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within 4 days.This time the replacement came and was good.

B08NW8GHCJ,AEVN7RMFICHOZR6CD2KNIV7LW4IQ,R1ZHN7T42QYEMK,Highly recommended,Good small cable. Yet to be tested though.
B08YXJJW8H,AFZE7KG2W5XOGLTWA2J4CSAHNXWA,R1OXPIKY99VS78,Good Quality but Slightly Pricey!!,Quality of the remote cover is quite good and it should be able to provide decent drop protection (as long as your remote doesn't land face first).It is slightly expensive though (should have been around ‚Çπ200 only) but does get the job done. Go for it if you wish to protect your Jio Set Top box remote.
B095JPKPH3,AG3QTVXT2ODRVKOQJJRDV5KA2F2A,R2PF9QV9JEQO9K,Almost Perfect!,Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates
B095JPKPH3,AGEYM57JOHPNX77ZYVSXPTX4FVNA,R2NEN86P63G4ES,Review After using 1month,the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube
B095JPKPH3,AHH557DUFIPFPRKDZ3K76U2DJ35Q,R302B7X6H0GIC0,Nice tv,Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However
B095JPKPH3,AE5WEK33Q53BHDQAPWRPVEN5OPZA,R3H9O8F9LUY5N9,Panel and video quality,after using it for 2 months
B095JPKPH3,AGFDV2VE2PFK2W7FQZXLEPHK2BAA,R1RGSA8QU78640,Good Product,the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now
B095JPKPH3,AFOOUANHTKWSTZRG3HSE3TR7L5CQ,R2B3DRF8V2A9QI,Worth for money,up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes
B095JPKPH3,AEV7X32J6CUVHXXRZJ7EI7XSXYVA,R1KF9HPUVJTM0I,Nice,I set brightness to 0
B095JPKPH3,AG7MREPON3XAAGY4WT4YGA7DZWCA,R3OCQ19TZWHSN5,Good,and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes

B0BF57RN3K,AGM7ETOYBL3UFKCLZW36JM6POQ6A,R1H7L32HFCGUIR,User friendly UI,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them

B0B3RRWSF6,AH3GZWZM5RVOFCJCXRU7QFBAJ5NQ,R2HXC35HKL6S3E,good for day to day use,i bought it due to that reason
B0B3RRWSF6,AGQ2RWOECSEFEQMIGE7VTXP65OKQ,R2CUWR6SL0MMRR,Good choice under budget of Rs2000,it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that
B0B3RRWSF6,AEVUBEFT2MRH2PRVW53SJEL7H42A,R3PWLUFNP117X0,Average product.,but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds
B0B3RRWSF6,AENY7L4XGCQMI627A27G3NVIBJNA,R2PK2034NVCPNH,Budget friendly,I believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10
B0B3RRWSF6,AHQISETKX3OXMZ4IX3YO7YV4UZ6Q,R2YJZKVTCUJAVZ,Overall it's a good watch,but we can only have 2
B0B3RRWSF6,AGESGUTIYJQOZ7PU563DHLYSPRTQ,R27X5G6UFUKCM9,Good product,1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks
B0B5B6PQCT,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that
B0B5B6PQCT,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,R23WEMNZK46UV3,Best for the budget üëç,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall
B0B5B6PQCT,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI
B0B5B6PQCT,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch
B0B5B6PQCT,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,RY95PJLUIT03E,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve
B0B5B6PQCT,AFZV4ISJSNGDUD5TU3VYMTYQ5JGA,R2HMI9LDLJ1S2Y,Super value for money,get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good
B0B5B6PQCT,AGKPRGZCV5XK7ZNVLQWUGRB6CVVQ,R216CF66UYJR2A,Awesome product,but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.
B0B5B6PQCT,AE7DX25DQCE7MXLEASO6I3YLWHRQ,R1XD0A6A2KGJZ6,Product itv,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.
B08HV83HL3,AG3SQH676VN5EH4NDNGVVLML6RZQ,R31BXRU0GAOB26,Ok product to buy,I haven‚Äôt used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance. Simply put it is not 20
B08HV83HL3,AFOCDYODRNB2UUBOTDLWKH76GP2A,R120Q9PAHZEIEM,Better than any other power banks,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah

B0BBN4DZBD,AHIBP55ZTOTM3MNBFPQKJIX4TONQ,RKU0JLLNRC05S,If you leave it only to make calls or receive calls,I have been using this phone for two months. According to the price range

B0BBN4DZBD,AFN2DMTSHR5SU7A7L3JRLM6E4C5Q,R287H4PDFLWV5,Budget phone,then you should compare it with Poco C31

B0B5LVS732,AHNRGHNIKN4JHV2RVCWX76B7ID6A,R2XEWWLV1LH7KX,For the price,heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo2 and stress measurement are not that much accurate
B0B5LVS732,AGIBUP4ENAQTEYCKPWASWCUJ7YXA,R3J0MEY15WI71Z,it is a good purchase but can be better,The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear
B0B5LVS732,AG5G6IU6RDTR24OHO3LSE24JCVEQ,R3HJ0GBBBUGEJZ,Happy with product...,there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there
B0B5LVS732,AHWCNVY76F7IBUHM7EBJBMQV7KBQ,R3TGTIJ54KHOL0,It's really smart with elegant design,but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch
B0B5LVS732,AHGYR3ZSYI6EPPK3N6SJPQIP53FA,R21TUQZLYNGC0M,Amazing,you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso

B09V2Q4QVQ,AH2SHWYEWDAK6A5Y2ZBEMZ2KIG3A,R3BZ3W2KH0X1DQ,Battery runs out quickly,listening songs purposes.I didn't face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would've been much better
B09V2Q4QVQ,AEYMOGP2CYRKYZ7TIDNLGR5QPZ4Q,R3GPO2WYK6ABG,Nokia trusted brand only needs to improve ringtone sound,if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms

B0BMGB3CH9,AGOWF5LLDDKUJTPYF4WOO5RKT4JA,R2RDC6R09NZ0TZ,Get it with bundled discounts.,It's original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended.

UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v

She is not a selfie or video person.Didnt want to go for Realme/Xiaomi(redmi/poco) products because of their support. This already comes with Android 12 and two year updates are assured.The display is really good. Not full HD screen though. Call quality is good.I wanted a smaller size but unfortunately

B09GFPVD9Y,AF7B5AJJZP2WKRD74Z45L7YDOEHA,RCP907FSHW2CI,Best phone for below normal use,If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.

This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.
B09GFLXVH9,AGEYI2JEUE752XDEXSTEIO7LJI5A,R2XSNFIDSF8IL4,Good mobile for minimal usage,This is worth for price

B0B3N7LR6K,AHQIYGWISGS2IQAQ3OM4IZHKIV4Q,R2FY1Z66KZXJWD,Nice watch but some cons,Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome
B0B3N7LR6K,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,R2HMU574902EOQ,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..
B0B3N7LR6K,AE4MORXG46LGABI76KRVGV5BCLMQ,R33J3X2N75IXU3,Good watch in this price,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇStrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..

B09ZQK9X8G,AEL5HU25IP7YT5WK3LXNC5M36NBA,R14ALM4LONM07K,Some improvement required,1. Please add app gallery when we do right to left swap on home screen. Because right to left swap or left to right swap have same pages.2. It should ring instead of vibrate in alarm or you can give it optional depends  on user.3. The temperature doesn't sync fast I have to go in the noisefit app  again and again and do it on and off in weather settings to sync feels like jugad. All these things can be fix from updates so pls try to do it
B09ZQK9X8G,AG6OO5TADBKM6RSXLN54U2LYYPXA,RBQ5KLENMT5W,Not best for tracking sleep,The watch looks cool and works very well but the sensors are not the most accurate. It shows that I am up 1 to 1¬Ω hour every night when I am not also the heart rate is generally higher than what it actually is and the calories burnt are lower
B09ZQK9X8G,AFBICZEMDBBG2PL7T424USBD3PNQ,RC8LE1R8ZUXK6,calories burnt of heart rate.,the pedometer is more or less accurate

B098NS6PVG,AECPFYFQVRUWC3KGNLJIOREFP5LQ,RGIQEG07R9HS2,A Good Braided Cable for Your Type C Device,I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.

B07WJV6P1R,AHWRZWPCTG6ICA7WTNLNNZXWFI5Q,R27MK332LTT5KS,Above average phone,I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.

B09T39K9YL,AHALPOEUQFGXEZR6NQ64ZI3EIYXA,R1S5FUVJK5BDKV,Solid phone,I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max
B09T39K9YL,AFJEOV652OA6P6CPXI6U34PC677A,R10T102N4IHERO,worth considering,and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce
B09T39K9YL,AEMQXD272M5OGFOTZDB3PBM2KSWA,R1QALRWVTEDXMH,Good Phone,but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used
B09T39K9YL,AHTNHTN3WQ3NHVW27TWJLRMQDG4A,R25MVXUNZDKPIY,Overall decent product,refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good
B09T39K9YL,AGXGWVE46AD3MXJRAA75U5VYV4VA,RJ0CS41K876BR,Apart from the camera everything is fine,better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures
B09T39K9YL,AEQIOSXDNEWT7VHJIRG5AVN2L7XA,RX87956266XU,Product is good,although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality
B09T39K9YL,AGZV3QEQWGL37PYNL6FF2FV25Z7A,R1HLEVV8WMVM3R,Honest Review after 14 days usage,but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions
B09T39K9YL,AETFDFDDPV5V47KNM2ZNBXJ3BCJQ,R1UBTZ9MAS7G8V,Superb but need improvement in camera,decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent

B0B5DDJNH4,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that
B0B5DDJNH4,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,R23WEMNZK46UV3,Best for the budget üëç,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall
B0B5DDJNH4,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI
B0B5DDJNH4,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch
B0B5DDJNH4,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,RY95PJLUIT03E,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve
B0B5DDJNH4,AFZV4ISJSNGDUD5TU3VYMTYQ5JGA,R2HMI9LDLJ1S2Y,Super value for money,get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good
B0B5DDJNH4,AGKPRGZCV5XK7ZNVLQWUGRB6CVVQ,R216CF66UYJR2A,Awesome product,but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.
B0B5DDJNH4,AE7DX25DQCE7MXLEASO6I3YLWHRQ,R1XD0A6A2KGJZ6,Product itv,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.

B094YFFSMY,AHTVBHRLCBX5E5GBPONFYZLCNBGQ,R3BGA0IR8XWNFF,Value for Money,The selfie stick is made up of cheap quality plastic.However the built structure of the selfie stick is stable and even the tripod stand will provide you ample support to make a video  time lapse or a portrait selfie.Recommended to all video bloggers who have just started their channels on YouTube or any other sites.Its worth a product with the money we are paying to purchase it.
B094YFFSMY,AEXRBZRUCAA7B3P4I2W344GKKEKQ,R1Z9SVTENNC9JG,After 1 month usage review,Did take this product on a trip. It's good but I was always afraid whether it's going to fell from the stand. The holder is clumpsy
B094YFFSMY,AGCRWVPOVID3SCYSXUIFZNEVZ5KQ,RE5OA1UZUJM9W,Good product,cannot hold it tighter. Need another person help to insert the phone in the stand or need to sit down and stretch the phone holder to insert the phone. Maybe not worth 399‚Çπ. Let me know if you have any other doubts

B09MT84WV5,AG5TXJG5DJ554EJX2GMQL67ZCP2Q,R91WZEICT9YIM,Good quality,they delivered fake sd card with the same samsung branding but thanks to Amazon for accepting return request. In third time I got this genuine Samsung Evo Plus SD Card 64gb. I purchased this card in Rs. 599. You can also get this at less price during offer season. The least price I have seen is Rs. 539.Performance is almost good as I expected.Write Speed is about 17 to 25 mbps and Reading speed is around 35 to 45 mbps. But I did not tested reading speed too much. May be you will get better reading speed. Adapter is also good quality and performing good.Thank You...üôÇ

B07WDKLRM4,AHWRZWPCTG6ICA7WTNLNNZXWFI5Q,R27MK332LTT5KS,Above average phone,I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.

B07RD611Z8,AFAKEZV7KMVT2SGF4KYWXGQRIW4A,R3C219XKJW9GI2,Decent Product at about right price.,I bought this power-bank to use during my vacation with family. It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself

B0B5D39BCD,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that
B0B5D39BCD,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,R23WEMNZK46UV3,Best for the budget üëç,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall

B0B5D39BCD,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch
B0B5D39BCD,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,RY95PJLUIT03E,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve

B08CF3D7QR,AFWD4ZTM7473CDWARHCDQKK73MTA,R8GBOLYUN5UP6,good but doesnt last,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design
B08CF3D7QR,AEXCQM3FDLX3YL3UJWWUIAIUJT4A,R1AYVO4R25KJTA,Good product,Good and durable product. Sometime the charges doesn't work on few adapters. there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter

B07WHQWXL7,AHWRZWPCTG6ICA7WTNLNNZXWFI5Q,R27MK332LTT5KS,Above average phone,I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.

B08HVJCW95,AFOCDYODRNB2UUBOTDLWKH76GP2A,R120Q9PAHZEIEM,Better than any other power banks,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah

B07WDK3ZS2,AEQCU4OWLDASI2OKORSLGN4UFUXA,R3V2BSMUA81YBR,I bought this mobile at 18k,there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings
B07WDK3ZS2,AHKQFWVTWLZQYGV6ZA6OCY333SNA,R11VQG0J80EBFL,worth on that price.,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue

B0B5CGTBKV,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that
B0B5CGTBKV,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,R23WEMNZK46UV3,Best for the budget üëç,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall
B0B5CGTBKV,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI
B0B5CGTBKV,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch
B0B5CGTBKV,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,RY95PJLUIT03E,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve
B0B5CGTBKV,AFZV4ISJSNGDUD5TU3VYMTYQ5JGA,R2HMI9LDLJ1S2Y,Super value for money,get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good
B0B5CGTBKV,AGKPRGZCV5XK7ZNVLQWUGRB6CVVQ,R216CF66UYJR2A,Awesome product,but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.
B0B5CGTBKV,AE7DX25DQCE7MXLEASO6I3YLWHRQ,R1XD0A6A2KGJZ6,Product itv,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.
B09KGV7WSV,AHJHHQWQ25VCIQHG5XMZN5MRZFYA,R1DVF8WQYO780,Really Satisfied with purchase.,Pros -Really like the stylus. It works fine
B09KGV7WSV,AFCFHU6B5RH4YN6DNTLUMY3CILHQ,R2B57KUCWYWDKX,DO NOT BELIEVE ANSWERS FOR QUESTIONS SAYING IT WORKS ON iPad Pro 10.5 inch (A1701),using it from last two months. Excellent for note taking. Tip quality is good doesn't wearing off. Extra tips provided. It provides all the functions which are mentioned. Charges quickly. Response time is really fast.Cons-Few times it automatically turned off while using
B09KGV7WSV,AGLNHKFYTWDPKIAIQTE4UPB5I7ZQ,R387VL6JFWOGER,Does all the necessary stuff,but not a big concern as it happens rarely.Not for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesn't support pressure features.Conclusion -For price under 2k I think it is the best stylus.I am using it with iPad air 5.Didn't face any issues till now so don't know how helpful customer care support is.
B09KGV7WSV,AEZKRUEG7M7P4JGJEVHMWZ3MGFPA,R1OI6WSW06GR1S,No Double Tap Gesture,So

B09KGV7WSV,AHYAIOJLTBNK23OEWQ2BELX3PVXA,R18TBS4UYVK90T,Very good product,I ordered it for my old iPad Pro 10.5 inch A1701 as I don‚Äôt want to buy new Apple Pencil at full price and I somehow couldn‚Äôt find the right alternative for 1st gen Apple Pencil either.. but I found some questions here answering it works for A1701.. after delivery
B09KGV7WSV,AHPP7A2M3LU7BWBZVIWXBNIVAPNA,R2Y87EUNNJCKL7,Automatically off's itself,I found out it actually won‚Äôt work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my Amazon Home Screen when I wanted to return this. Gonna order a new one which KINGONE says works with A1701. Let‚Äôs see..
B09KGV7WSV,AG6FKYZZA7HPN54KNFM5EIKJNDSQ,R3KEMD6RG0SKOI,Value for money pen,Very good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly .
B0BNV7JM5Y,AEYLB6L333GKGCRGR5N6NDB335TQ,R2IIY08QX4SR46,Feature Wise OK at this Price But Sometimes call screen not come on the display of Watch,This review is based on my two days of usage. Work fine on Activity and Fitness Tracking but Sometimes Software does misbehave.

I believe problems which are coming may be solved by the next Software updates. Entry Label Smartwatch with calling features wise ok.

B0BMGG6NKT,AGOWF5LLDDKUJTPYF4WOO5RKT4JA,R2RDC6R09NZ0TZ,Get it with bundled discounts.,It's original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v

B09GFM8CGS,AF7B5AJJZP2WKRD74Z45L7YDOEHA,RCP907FSHW2CI,Best phone for below normal use,If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.
B09GFM8CGS,AGEYI2JEUE752XDEXSTEIO7LJI5A,R2XSNFIDSF8IL4,Good mobile for minimal usage,This is worth for price
B09GFM8CGS,AGNNZL2OXJSOP4LC4PWWYSTCZAAA,R2JB9PO5MV9LER,but technically highly worth,has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage

The calorie and heart beat tracker are also quite accurate. The watch is a bit uncomfortable to watch at times

B08K4RDQ71,AFH7NASUMH66QSOAFC3OEXCF5LNQ,R25MFNHA3G4KVK,very fast and smooth work,Works perfectly on Samsung S22 Plus. I often use it for video editing too. But I think it's overpriced. I got it for Rs. 389 including delivery charges. It should cost max upto 250. 2 stars have been cut for overpricing.
B09YV3K34W,AEJQT5NMTAM2ZRPQDNGLOL6NTKRQ,R26YAKWWPQSNL,Worth the price,Received the product today. The packing was intact though I found watch not at its proper place.

B09YV3K34W,AHLORXFV6I3JRBNER3O6DIOVWM5A,R39640821J2S6S,Just Go For It,phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display
B09YV3K34W,AH445QA3XXIV6FPASBU6OBICSLYQ,R75IA3ZAEBTFU,It's good product in this range,display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.

B09Z6WH2N1,AGHIZULBQOJPXZ2EUBOVSCRTBI4A,R1R39X4XI4GF5N,Very useful item to make your phone cables long lasting,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially
B09Z6WH2N1,AEFNEVSP4WMJVLBSRPH3YKKRSDWA,R2NR5VY4ULMZGZ,Price can be reduced as this product is not worth for 80 rs,apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn‚Äôt last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now

B07WGPKMP5,AHWRZWPCTG6ICA7WTNLNNZXWFI5Q,R27MK332LTT5KS,Above average phone,I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.

B0BBFJ9M3X,AF3U4PQTRSBX3JB6NUI4Q652IE4Q,R1EU6W1X8DZQN1,15 day review,Tbh it's a good phone for your parents. Of you are a heavy user then don't consider this phone.Cons:-1. Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months

B07WHSJXLF,AHKQFWVTWLZQYGV6ZA6OCY333SNA,R11VQG0J80EBFL,worth on that price.,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue

B09LHYZ3GJ,AEE6AOZ236TYFSCLGHGXIIG2SFUQ,R125UHW97PT3OH,Works amazing and buttery smooth,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there's no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face
B09LHYZ3GJ,AEZR42M5D6YTRJ732HWXBM5YEGKQ,R1GNNZDXKP43DG,design kinda boring though,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing
B09LHYZ3GJ,AFCR3Q2LBT2KWRN42AOROJEDECNA,R1ZDKQ5659C68H,Good,but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty
B09LHYZ3GJ,AET435JGPEIORB35LT7EZ4ASDRRQ,R36FYJ9DGL1QL1,Overall good under this budget,Good
B09LHYZ3GJ,AENNEXWQZKHYRUEMUASXQG6O4GDQ,R1IZDBZW18XJPH,not bad,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.

B09LJ116B5,AFE2LQATN64EXU6NVTTEMV5XKDGA,R29RZ6S6SY3H4F,Overall good phone,Using it from last 3 months now. Battery backup is good
B09LJ116B5,AEJA3E7VLQFEQGJGJLV3KOZPXJMA,R2MZ7BZ4991B7O,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep,camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now
B09LJ116B5,AEE6AOZ236TYFSCLGHGXIIG2SFUQ,R125UHW97PT3OH,Works amazing and buttery smooth,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there's no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face
B09LJ116B5,AEZR42M5D6YTRJ732HWXBM5YEGKQ,R1GNNZDXKP43DG,design kinda boring though,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing
B09LJ116B5,AFCR3Q2LBT2KWRN42AOROJEDECNA,R1ZDKQ5659C68H,Good,but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty
B09LJ116B5,AET435JGPEIORB35LT7EZ4ASDRRQ,R36FYJ9DGL1QL1,Overall good under this budget,Good
B09LJ116B5,AENNEXWQZKHYRUEMUASXQG6O4GDQ,R1IZDBZW18XJPH,not bad,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.

It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.
B07XLCFSSN,AHQKC4MLLVOPBTKJFDBGTXFRKLYQ,R1EBFTZINSJ0LG,Great value for price,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.

B0B8ZWNR5T,AGHIZULBQOJPXZ2EUBOVSCRTBI4A,R1R39X4XI4GF5N,Very useful item to make your phone cables long lasting,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially
B0B8ZWNR5T,AEFNEVSP4WMJVLBSRPH3YKKRSDWA,R2NR5VY4ULMZGZ,Price can be reduced as this product is not worth for 80 rs,apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn‚Äôt last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now

B0BBFJLP21,AF3U4PQTRSBX3JB6NUI4Q652IE4Q,R1EU6W1X8DZQN1,15 day review,Tbh it's a good phone for your parents. Of you are a heavy user then don't consider this phone.Cons:-1. Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months

B09LHZSMRR,AEZR42M5D6YTRJ732HWXBM5YEGKQ,R1GNNZDXKP43DG,design kinda boring though,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing
B09LHZSMRR,AFCR3Q2LBT2KWRN42AOROJEDECNA,R1ZDKQ5659C68H,Good,but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty
B09LHZSMRR,AET435JGPEIORB35LT7EZ4ASDRRQ,R36FYJ9DGL1QL1,Overall good under this budget,Good
B09LHZSMRR,AENNEXWQZKHYRUEMUASXQG6O4GDQ,R1IZDBZW18XJPH,not bad,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.

B09BNXQ6BR,AEEMDECLMB6ZOYW4MZDRUTMPNDMQ,R1UQ0AYNB30CZS,Good product at this price range,the battery of this watch is so good that before use i charged this watch and it's been 2 weeks and this watch still have 25% battery left. And nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake
B09BNXQ6BR,AGCDPH7XJBZZ6ALNCA6XYKP3BZIA,R34O4E591I5RJN,Ok,i tried to return this and I've called Amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after 5min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it. Watch have some basic futures and i like it.
B09BNXQ6BR,AEZHGBDTPEAIDEC4HF753JL7NDNQ,R2X9U1VWHBNIAX,Satisfied,One of the best product in this price range. Been using it for a year now and I have no complaints. Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well
B09BNXQ6BR,AFNGYI4A433E2ZEIJ4PTRXTOFSCQ,RPRRWM1J2QDNP,Watch ‚åöÔ∏è Review,since I have been using it for almost a year now.Good product for this price range.

B01FSYQ2A4,AFWOX5BA5QS5TCVTNV3EHQXOSCLQ,R2E3GV1LFGQNFD,Worth Every Square Inch.,"-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap"
B01FSYQ2A4,AGGM4C652EG6WSDEOWBQCR7UXG7Q,R3IM6TBVGY4SYQ,VFM,I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately
B01FSYQ2A4,AFZ3S6RJS6RVOXVK5OAIT4AX76UA,R236B8Q3BSGZJ7,Plastic build. Must buy,he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart
B01FSYQ2A4,AFRUXOMHPM4OTISKC4VE3PM45DTQ,RO9KNXZ2RH2TI,3 years of extensive usage,people
B01FSYQ2A4,AFGX776XSUUA2LIYKLHSXN3PHOXA,RT2VNM024LSCP,delivered the perfomance to its price,you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back
B01FSYQ2A4,AF6XZI4LVIVFP2UTPNVFYGF7JPQQ,R3PRBLGHPRCZ6A,Still working after 2 years,and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy
B01FSYQ2A4,AGYX7IY6ZHCU2J6DXRW5SN6LGEVA,R1AYA1JIHAVM50,Low in price but sound was high,"for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud"

B09GFPN6TP,AF7B5AJJZP2WKRD74Z45L7YDOEHA,RCP907FSHW2CI,Best phone for below normal use,If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.
B09GFPN6TP,AGEYI2JEUE752XDEXSTEIO7LJI5A,R2XSNFIDSF8IL4,Good mobile for minimal usage,This is worth for price

B0B3NDPCS9,AHQIYGWISGS2IQAQ3OM4IZHKIV4Q,R2FY1Z66KZXJWD,Nice watch but some cons,Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome
B0B3NDPCS9,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,R2HMU574902EOQ,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..
B0B3NDPCS9,AE4MORXG46LGABI76KRVGV5BCLMQ,R33J3X2N75IXU3,Good watch in this price,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇStrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..

B0B5B6PQCT,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that
B0B5B6PQCT,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,R23WEMNZK46UV3,Best for the budget üëç,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall
B0B5B6PQCT,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI
B0B5B6PQCT,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch
B0B5B6PQCT,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,RY95PJLUIT03E,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve
B0B5B6PQCT,AFZV4ISJSNGDUD5TU3VYMTYQ5JGA,R2HMI9LDLJ1S2Y,Super value for money,get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good
B0B5B6PQCT,AGKPRGZCV5XK7ZNVLQWUGRB6CVVQ,R216CF66UYJR2A,Awesome product,but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.
B0B5B6PQCT,AE7DX25DQCE7MXLEASO6I3YLWHRQ,R1XD0A6A2KGJZ6,Product itv,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.
B01J0XWYKQ,AHYCGGRP7XQVIYP6NRVZI6A7FH2A,RX492E2N9MM6W,Good,feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight

B0B5LVS732,AFGHRQK34D54OXQCRGX5K3XTR66Q,R10I6UIAQIP9TN,Sumit Nath,Touch screen functions well .step counting is not that much accurate
B0B5LVS732,AHNRGHNIKN4JHV2RVCWX76B7ID6A,R2XEWWLV1LH7KX,For the price,heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo2 and stress measurement are not that much accurate
B0B5LVS732,AGIBUP4ENAQTEYCKPWASWCUJ7YXA,R3J0MEY15WI71Z,it is a good purchase but can be better,The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear
B0B5LVS732,AG5G6IU6RDTR24OHO3LSE24JCVEQ,R3HJ0GBBBUGEJZ,Happy with product...,there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there
B0B5LVS732,AHWCNVY76F7IBUHM7EBJBMQV7KBQ,R3TGTIJ54KHOL0,It's really smart with elegant design,but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch
B0B5LVS732,AHGYR3ZSYI6EPPK3N6SJPQIP53FA,R21TUQZLYNGC0M,Amazing,you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso

B0B5LVS732,AGFHRUWQ7C3KCBL6IKJ4BC3JSZKQ,R1KOD8YMT3FJ7I,All good,why does the watch not have audio alarms
B07XCM6T4N,AGGXWYRLPMULBPR7OXPEV6SNOMIQ,R194PSSW507V7K,Stability should have been better.,Product is very fine in all aspects except in cost. Cost could have been less
B01DEWVZ2C,AFE54I72EV2YOL6POJCHHP3Q5NWA,R2NB2K5XC70FKP,Good maybe okay,The quality is not upto mark for the price paid. Other brands offer good quality earphones with lesser price. But per my experience none of my earphones have lasted more than 1-1.5 years.Given that this is JBL
B01DEWVZ2C,AFKLES3QOCRLIMJWHPEJVGK4RX3Q,R3623Q21H3MKP6,Defective Product Delivered,lets see how long it lasts.Can someone build a earphone which lasts couple of years? I'll buy :)
B01DEWVZ2C,AFLBOY3G7HT3TAYCHSRFBXF7M2MQ,R1XVC6NEYU3ZHV,Amazing Sound at Budget,I had purchased two units of same headset of which one was found to be defective. Since I was on travel I couldn't check the items immediately and by time I found item to be defective the return/ replacement window has elapsed.
B01DEWVZ2C,AF2NZ4L5OXBCMZZ742VSQGWU2F3A,RNFY9ZYM6195O,Not for bass lover,Build Quality is average considering JBL a global brand providing u an amazing sounding earphone under 700. Highly recommended if u r a music lover.

B09YV4RG4D,AFIIBGWYNYPKBPVV3YRZPI3PYGBA,R560D18O1BJM7,Excellent Product,review is as below :PROS :1) Looks
B09YV4RG4D,AF6HCCU2LSBC7VI7PXDP7BV234VA,RYPXAOQI77XRF,The Tracking and touch would be better,it looks premium.2) Features at this price range3) Battery : It seems as if the battery will easily last for a week or more with normal usage ( Have closed all notifications which saves battery )4) Steps Accuracy : Will give 8 out of 105) Magnetic charger ( easy to charge )CONS :1) Have not noticed anything till now.
B09YV4RG4D,AFOFD4PXG6Q4MMOSO5DL3Z6SPH3A,R2T1AP2XBIAQBK,Bluetooth connectivity,I ordered 2 watches for my wife and sister. Got it at the price of 1500. I am always a fan of Firebolt. And ninja 3 is very good. Touch responce is good. Good battery life. Sleep track is very occuracy. It has all necessary features and those are quite accurate. It's light weight and looks good. Over all it's an excellent product at this price.
B09YV4RG4D,AFJLVCFIQOLK52GX6GEPNDVDXMLQ,RU2RYKNTJU52I,Very good,Touch screen is not so good it takes time may be i need to use it for a while for better experience

B07TCN5VR9,AECPFYFQVRUWC3KGNLJIOREFP5LQ,R2GVOJLXANNFG2,A Good wired headset in budget.,This is my first product from Boult. I wanted a wired earphone and when I searched on Amazon I found Boult in such a low price and I ordered it. Recieved it today.Checked it by connecting to my phone and I was surprised by the audio quality. This is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good. The build quality is average and you can't complain considering the price. It also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old Nokia days. It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So
B09YV4MW2T,AEJQT5NMTAM2ZRPQDNGLOL6NTKRQ,R26YAKWWPQSNL,Worth the price,Received the product today. The packing was intact though I found watch not at its proper place. It fell down inside the box and found the inner holding box damaged also. Not expecting any kind of tampering but thought to share the product packaging. Overall nice product
B09YV4MW2T,AHIKFQ5VP6QGYQK3GJICMV4U7ULA,R30L263BU0PTZP,expecting good performance on extended use,will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.

B09YV4MW2T,AFLEQIFCKD7EUBQTHJ7T7XF4MWMQ,RBTZE0Y27F7IZ,Good budget calling smart watch.,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder
B09YV4MW2T,AHLORXFV6I3JRBNER3O6DIOVWM5A,R39640821J2S6S,It's a mind blowing watch,display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.
B09YV4MW2T,AH445QA3XXIV6FPASBU6OBICSLYQ,R75IA3ZAEBTFU,It's good product in this range,Just bought it
B09YV4MW2T,AHT6SE3YNTHR76UT4QDQKBHEH5EQ,RCVN98N40B1C5,Very Good watch in this price Range,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good
B01HJI0FS2,AGLYWTUJ7XAWSKGMRXZEMUHNN3QA,R2X4UKYY57A9JX,Best mouse at this price,Been using this mouse for the last 4 years both in office and at home. Suits my hand the best
B01HJI0FS2,AGAPGK7QBUJDHYEHVEZIJSSU6RXQ,R3J71TYH2ISEUY,Item is good.  No issues,tried some gaming mouse at 500-800 range but the feel is not good and my wrist starts to hurt on those cheap mice. This one is the father of all mice in that sense as it ticks all the boxes for me. Obviously you cant expect some god like gaming performance but its decent and for everything else it's the best.
B01HJI0FS2,AH3M2HOCS7VMTXCOYYI2AKZTFQDA,R2IYAMOBWJY5JC,Rough and affordable,A bit short in height

B0B3N7LR6K,AHQIYGWISGS2IQAQ3OM4IZHKIV4Q,R2FY1Z66KZXJWD,Nice watch but some cons,Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome
B0B3N7LR6K,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,R2HMU574902EOQ,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..
B0B3N7LR6K,AE4MORXG46LGABI76KRVGV5BCLMQ,R33J3X2N75IXU3,Good watch in this price,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇStrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..

But does the job. Go for this if you want to experiment with HDMI as I wasn't sure it would work for me or not. Otherwise go for a good quality breaded cable.

B09Z6WH2N1,AEFNEVSP4WMJVLBSRPH3YKKRSDWA,R2NR5VY4ULMZGZ,Price can be reduced as this product is not worth for 80 rs,apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn‚Äôt last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now

B07XJYYH7L,AF4X3QT4KW3DV2HUMQVSOJDISOOQ,RTATA9H2ELJ81,Looks good,Although it is written fast charging. However it charges quite slow compared to original chargers

B07KRCW6LZ,AEI36WUCG27UYFAGDF7HX74VEGIA,RTWMPZGIX9EDV,Easy plug and play,Excellent product revived by old laptop.
B07KRCW6LZ,AGW3NGXVSGUB34Q5V6ACANURQMGQ,R3TRCC0769D12A,Only 200mbps support,I got this product because for some reason my laptop's internal WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working. Now there are options to buy two separate devices but this solves my purpose and it doesn't sticks out as well.It's having Dual WiFi but I will suggest you to use on 5GHz as the 2.4GHz is a bit slow

B08D9NDZ1Y,AH6LPYJT5UBJ7CIEWVHDCNQAGWZQ,RS75FOY13AIG9,Good Product,Qualitywise the plastic body used is fragile (like you get a feel that it might break). Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it's very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it's not the best
B08D9NDZ1Y,AGX3GCRGFU4IHAJZRUP655EEGSQA,R3E7YWE1ALH6JF,Average,but not worst also - it's 4.8/5. I feel it's a bit overpriced as well.I connected to my Windows 10 laptop
B08WJ86PV2,AHTNFP2NA52A4C2BE5WK6PFOCSIQ,R1AJ8691TX1VPW,Good,There are folds when I have received the product. I am writing this review after using it for 2.5 months. It's working fine. There is no wear and tear as of now. As per look it looks good on my black table. You can just put keyboard and mouse on it. Nothing much can be placed. Grip to the table is also really good
B08WJ86PV2,AH3HKWLRRJWVLWWNSNRI67WU77ZQ,R1F6CCFSHMMDWL,The smell....,The size is alright
B08WJ86PV2,AHNK4EL2BOSS6WRMONWHNWAF5KRA,R2BX7280T023IK,For starter,but overall daily usage its really good.
B00LM4X3XE,AE6HGV4SSK2V4C4QVOKY42KZW2DQ,R19F1VFEULFO9,It's dark!,just go for it. I'm using it for calligraphy it's perfect!

I am not a gamer and this review is NOT for a gaming PC. Its very convenient for my office work. The cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling pad.

B07232M876,AF7IXQKBUL6NEIQG4R53LMJJUGXQ,R22EUJ1B1AM0OU,Using it with my QC 3 Charger .So far- So good.A Quality cable with a sturdy construction & troublefree performance.,ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit
B07232M876,AFODI4XXHXHBFFUHK7N5LVKWEXTQ,R2K89RVGN8N9MO,Awesome product go for buy it üëç,Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit
B07232M876,AGNONTMQDE5KLLDEEB57Z3C5WAEA,R177X9L6ND6OA7,Execellent,Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car
B07232M876,AFW6NV5N3FUXV3CNUACPSYC5AB3Q,R2YU5RDRT44DE6,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob
B07232M876,AEW6KBDGJEWIOQKAW3FP74GMV6TA,R1K5FLRLAUZLKF,Super,I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility
B07232M876,AEGT7WPGXXMSH5J3LZLL6CPJ7QMQ,R1HAZS2PLM3RRQ,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance
B07232M876,AEKCUG7WMX6KMP6VFBWI3ICW5CBQ,R3EX1BCG3VPANF,Good,I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable
B07232M876,AF2544C4RGIBQX7Y4JMKMSMXMRRQ,R1C72DNWTJGUI2,Excellent quality cable,there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps.

As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly¬†the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with¬†acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows¬†laptops as they are having¬†the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.¬†This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid¬†will not harm the screen

B07P681N66,AHDFR3PDKEBV72HXRL3RJJLS3YYA,R2GUL8IL005EGF,Works flawlessly on Ubuntu 22.04 (if installed correctly),I am using this on an old Mac Mini
B07P681N66,AHYUZ2BLKNN6UJLFYWCXCEFZTOVQ,R3NZCVYJBN0CPD,Best for kali. Do not read another review.,since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds
B07P681N66,AHBST4ZJ5665DV2TCR4W4J2OI3DA,RHUJOS46Q51UG,Nice product,"at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon"
B07P681N66,AGHPOFCHZ73Q2Q2IFTCJLUSEL2NQ,R1ZW4PQHUECROJ,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit

B07P681N66,AESJE2EZD7S7WOYBN7RE7ZF3J2MA,R1JRRVOFWQAC4C,Superb,bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before
B07P681N66,AF23GXF525XSMXPJBEHP4SPKOZNQ,R2WZHK2E301YV,Awesome and easy to use,the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS
B07P681N66,AFX5NHAAOUKKENAT6GWNKY3X5YTQ,R10J01VHCKFB42,Good product,which also worked.Ultimately

B082T6V3DT,AGFN3SLEECW6DYL2CVGLIHJCVVHA,R2SB3XYC8XHNUQ,Quality is really good,Length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good

B082T6V3DT,AEHU6ETDR7HVQOGLKITDETHZEO7A,R29J3JSPZYQYCM,It charges fine for me,but the whole cable was pink

And nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake
B094JB13XL,AGCDPH7XJBZZ6ALNCA6XYKP3BZIA,R34O4E591I5RJN,Ok,i tried to return this and I've called Amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after 5min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it. Watch have some basic futures and i like it.
B094JB13XL,AEZHGBDTPEAIDEC4HF753JL7NDNQ,R2X9U1VWHBNIAX,Satisfied,One of the best product in this price range. Been using it for a year now and I have no complaints. Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well
B094JB13XL,AFNGYI4A433E2ZEIJ4PTRXTOFSCQ,RPRRWM1J2QDNP,Watch ‚åöÔ∏è Review,since I have been using it for almost a year now.Good product for this price range.

Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap"
B01FSYQ2A4,AGGM4C652EG6WSDEOWBQCR7UXG7Q,R3IM6TBVGY4SYQ,VFM,I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately
B01FSYQ2A4,AFZ3S6RJS6RVOXVK5OAIT4AX76UA,R236B8Q3BSGZJ7,Plastic build. Must buy,he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart
B01FSYQ2A4,AFRUXOMHPM4OTISKC4VE3PM45DTQ,RO9KNXZ2RH2TI,3 years of extensive usage,people
B01FSYQ2A4,AFGX776XSUUA2LIYKLHSXN3PHOXA,RT2VNM024LSCP,delivered the perfomance to its price,you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back
B01FSYQ2A4,AF6XZI4LVIVFP2UTPNVFYGF7JPQQ,R3PRBLGHPRCZ6A,Still working after 2 years,and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy
B01FSYQ2A4,AGYX7IY6ZHCU2J6DXRW5SN6LGEVA,R1AYA1JIHAVM50,Low in price but sound was high,"for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud"

B0148NPH9I,AEA7RJWIWRHGUYKUP6LJBPRSZCDA,R3QQUAIJT1HNL4,A Robust,and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion

B08R69VDHT,AEDLLY6JXNCVYIW227SBCPVYHNUA,R9ISXRV6DA0OY,Nice quality‚Ä¶ trustable‚Ä¶,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price
B08R69VDHT,AGTJ44UNO6K5X567YLQPYGN3TV4Q,RZFW11UFTCBVH,Just well in this price.,na
B08R69VDHT,AFYCBABBI2GCQRSCKIRHPLQNO72A,R1WGHB13Q2OLYA,supports 2.4 amps fast charging,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that
B08R69VDHT,AG55XGEMTFKS7BXQTNFKHFTMMW5A,R11ETJ640KDIRW,Nice,i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging

B09RWZRCP1,AFJVYK4FXVGRSTSLGVUE5JGB2NVA,RMEKYV7XWTWKV,Better..!!,Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...
B09RWZRCP1,AEVJIJSEUXPBRKOQ2PB4JNBUTFRA,R1PYVXH6MGUQLU,Charging speed is not guaranteed!,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables
B09RWZRCP1,AGRLDCPA7VJZZTV4GUIODVQ3DTHA,R3FUT08S34HBHW,Exactly as advertised,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable
B09RWZRCP1,AEUDATTJUCKFQ5ETVLUU57ZZ3XXQ,R2X57Q7030Q9DG,Excellent warp charge cable,that would make it more durable. In my experience
B09RWZRCP1,AEGR6ZYWXPEZWM7JUEBWQHAOPS2A,REPXGC5R2LG85,Nice,braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent
B09RWZRCP1,AEETOHX32FYDRI6SIAW7L76Q2NHQ,R399JBQZ8JKDKC,Amazing cable,I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.

I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance
B07GVGTSLN,AFDDH5QGUJ2NHJZBIAPEQVUIQCKA,R33YS4PO3JWU23,Fast charging is working properly,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.

B009P2LK08,AEFDI2YRIMBNCPVHEGTCZ3EEJJBQ,RQCGOLYO4S7UF,Worth to money,Less heating according to the price.

B01I1LDZGA,AEY6PEMQ7DII44WSUSC67JEWDE3A,R1EYKC1W1EPYIL,There is no flame adjustment,1. Heating happens on one side of the vessel only. Heating is not distributed around the center of vessel. Hence milk stains happens only on one side of the vessel. Refer image.2. During cleaning water may go inside the temperature control knob. So washing should be carefully done.The above points should be considered for better design of the Kettle.

B08G8H8DPL,AH6XUPCGCWOG63XDNA4PRPWFX4XA,R3EUCFMNX3LPQX,The juicer is useless but blender/grinder/mixer is fine,The juicer part seems badly designed as the fruit get stuck and only after half a glass of juice you have it jammed and have to clean it.Don't get this if you want a juicer.Rest is pretty good
B083J64CBB,AEAHCVLMYLKLICSIKCTUS54NVQ2A,R253NRG08YZO1Y,Good bag,The bag has two stitched fabric straps on either side that act as handles. These straps are not stitched properly and will break easily.

B08MZNT7GP,AHLCFOXSW7PKG6NWJAYZXJJBHCPQ,RVITAAYFIMZKT,Good product,there is no mechanism to know the temperature which is being set by rotating the temperature setting knob. You simply have to guess initially and then wait and do trial and error as the temperature starts increasing slowly. It's a slow process and you can't get the right temperature in one go!Digital display of temperature setting may be added.This is a general problem- I didn't find digital display in any brand. This can easily become a differentiating feature.This will be particularly very useful for elderly people.In today's time when electronics is everywhere

B0B9F9PT8R,AFK6D62HRZSHP5W3DE5QGYUYJQEA,RNFDIM9PF1C9U,Very beautiful heater but costly and less useful,It is very beautiful looking and appears imported good for placing at one spot on office table etc. and not to be moved. It is very light so easily tumbles down. wire cord is very short. Heating is good. It is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody which will break if it falls down.
